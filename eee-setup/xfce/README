The dot-config tarball is a set of comfortable settings for XFCE.

You can create your own by getting an XFCE environment just like you like is
and then running : 

tar -czf SOMEONE-dot-config.tar.gz /home/SOMEONE/.config

and storing the resulting file in this directory.

It will then appear in the /root/eee-setup/xfce directory once the RPM is
rebuilt.

You can then unzip it into the right place with:
tar -xzf /root/eee-setup/xfce/SOMETHING-dot-config.tar.gz -C /home/SOMEONE/
