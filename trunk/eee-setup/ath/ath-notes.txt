I tested the patch file with svn version r2992 in Fedora 8. It work, but just want to inform that I have to blacklist ath5k module. It installed/load by default in Fedora 8.

nbd, I don't understand why this patch can't be committed to madwifi. The patch did submitted by atheros, right? Maybe I should google about ABI breakage. Thanks.

yum install madwifi






new_ath_pci 98340 0
new_ath_rate_sample 14080 1 new_ath_pci
new_wlan 204892 2 new_ath_pci,new_ath_rate_sample
wlan 144924 0
new_ath_hal 191312 2 new_ath_pci,new_ath_rate_sample

These are the mad-wifi drivers but they must be the "new" drivers, not the ones that are part of restricted-modules. I suspect that they could be corrupted incorrectly built.

The lsmod should look like this:

ath_pci 81852 0
ath_rate_sample 17224 1 ath_pci
wlan 146684 4 wlan_wep,ath_pci,ath_rate_sample
ath_hal 148848 3 ath_pci,ath_rate_sample


run these commands & post results:

sudo lshw -C network

lspci -v | grep Ethernet

I had the exact same problem with a new toshiba satellite with ar5006eg wifi card; the solution for me was to download the latest build from madwifi (release this month) compile and install ; before compiling and installing, remove any loaded ath* modules (ath_hal and ath_pci) with modprobe; then run make and then make install ; you'll need linux-headers packages installed ; also the installer will detect that an older version of madwifi drivers are installed, chose option to remove ; hope this helps



I just successfully installed madwifi onto fresh installed Edgy 64bit.
My laptop: BenQ P41, Turion X2, Ati X1100, Atheros Ar5006eg.

The driver that works with this card can be found here:
http://snapshots.madwifi.org/madwifi-ng/
The version that works is r1711 or later (in fact I installed the latest).

On fresh Edgy, restricted-modules is not installed so I just went head & installed that driver directly.
go to your madwifi folder
$ cd scripts
$ ./madwifi-unload.bash
$ ./find-madwifi-modules.sh /lib/modules/
$ cd ..
$ sudo make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo modprobe ath_pci
$sudo modprobe wlan_scan_sta
$ sudo ifconfig ath0 up
System - administration - networking: My wireless device is now listed in here

If you have restricted-modules already installed, you must disable & uninstall it first
$ sudo ifconfig ath0 down
after $ sudo make above:
$ sudo make uninstall




I have an Amilo Li 1720 with a built-in AR5006EG chipset and I cannot get it to work under Feisty. I do not know whether this is significant, but the WLAN LED does not lid up after Ubuntu has booted although I did use the BIOS setting "Enable WLAN at boot". I'd be happy to post anything in order to get closer to a solution. Right now, I'm a little bit at a loss.
I can see different wlan-networks, but I cannot connect. 

EDIT: The following two simple commands solved my problems:

$ sudo modprobe acerhk autowlan=1
$ echo 1 | sudo tee > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled




Just a quick word for anyone who stumbles across this post with a similar problem. I was unable to get madwifi to work - reports on the madwifi website suggest other users with the same hardware also have this problem. It seems that this adaptor is just a little bit new right now. But I'm sure madwifi will be on it soon.

However, I have, after much fumbling and tweaking, been able to get ndiswrapper to work using the windows drivers. The main stumbling block to this was actually finding the driver in my windows install (for this card, I needed net5211.inf and ar5211.sys), and a problem with the 4K stack of the kernel that ships with FC5. This was fixed by using a 16K stack kernel, from linuxant (remember to get the development package as well, that installs kernel source required to build kernel modules for drivers).

With ndiswrapper and the windows drivers set up, I then had to write a simple file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts called ifcfg-wlan0 (I copied the one that was there for eth0). This got the ndiswrapper module loading at bootup, and associated the wlan0 device with the actual hardware. Everything has been working thus far.

For other advice on how I got this working, see the thread in this forum entitled 'ndiswrapper working - now how do I configure wlan?'.

Happy wirelessing,

Fixing Fedora 8 wireless problem

http://coyotesg.blogspot.com/

Fedora 8's wireless is really disappointing.

So far, bugs findings include

1. wpa_supplicant is buggy & cannot connect.
2. default ath_5k driver conflicts with madwifi driver from livna
3. network manager is also buggy.

I have a DLink G520 using the atheros chipset. Here is how I managed to get it working.
Note: This method will give you a fixed ip 192.168.0.17(or dhcp ip if you like) & the startup
files will connect you to your preferred wireless network without any manual intervention by users
like using network manager, which does not work anyway.

1. Blacklist ath_5k in /etc/modprobe.conf & /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.
2. Installed kmod-madwifi from livna
3. disabled network manager as it will interfere with the configuration below.
4. updated wpa_supplicant

Tricky steps:

5. Previous version of Fedora before 8, atheros chipset is recognized as ath0. In
Fedora 8, this does not work. Atheros chispet is recognized as wlan0. So, I have
changed all previous reference to ath0 to wlan0.
6. I removed the ath_5k driver from kernel as some suggested. Not sure if this is
absolutely necessary though.
7. At /etc/rc5.d, there is this file SXXwpa_supplicant. My case, XX=12. Change it to a bigger
no. I changed it to 98. Reason being, wpa_supplicant was started before other services &
so it does not work. S98wpa_supplicant makes wpa_supplicant starts after most other services.
8. 4 files to be modified/created

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-wlan0
/etc/dhclient-wlan0.conf
/etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
