## Overview ##

The Asus Eee 701 PC comes with a nice-and-easy UI, on top of a Xandros (debian-based) core.

However, for 'power users' familiar with RedHat distributions, it's far more comfortable to use a version of Fedora, customized for the Eee machine.

This project includes the files necessary to build a custom spin of Fedora (using their excellent tools), put it onto a CD (or USB key) as a Live version to test it out, and then install it as a replacement for the Asus default.

## Goals ##
This project's goal is to have a Live (and installable) distribution that :
  * Is Fedora (currently Fedora 8)
  * Runs XFCE as a windowing environment
  * Takes as little space on the Eee's Flash drive as possible
  * Gives the user the option of installing bigger packages (like openoffice, media players, etc)
  * Understands each piece of hardware on the Eee (wireless, webcam, speakers, etc)
  * ... and generally gives everyone a sense of satisfaction.

## Documentation ##
There are a few more Wiki pages over at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:eeedora , and there's a downloadable ISO available at http://eeedora.complexvalues.com/ .

  * The [Basic Approach](BasicApproach.md) taken with getting this spin working
  * Notes on getting the [wired internet](WiredInternet.md) to work
  * Notes on [creating a Live USB install](HowTo.md)
