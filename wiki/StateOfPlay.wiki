#summary Where the EeeDora setup stands now

= What it Does Do =

  * Boots Fedora 8 on a Live USB or Live CD, connected to the Eee PC USB ports
  * Goes into an XFCE windowing environment
  * Sets up a few defaults for the windowing environment 
    * _Thanks to the framework from [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RahulSundaram Rahul Sundaram] and [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ChristophWickert Christoph Wickert] at the Fedora project_
  * ...

= What it Doesn't Do (yet) =

  * Sort out the /etc/fstab issues (to avoid over-using the Flash drive)
  * Bring up the wireless connection (Atheros)
  * Handle suspend/resume gracefully (haven't actually checked yet)
  * Use 3D acceleration for X (may be possible)
  * Have a boot process optimized for speed
  * ...

= What it Doesn't Do Generally =

  * Include a lot of bloat (let the user choose what they need)
  * Anything half as nice as the default Xandros UI
  * Give any protection from Microsoft patent FUD (ouch!)
