#summary Creation of an Installable Live USB

== Quick version ==

  * Check out the SVN anonymously
  * If you want to build a USB image, make sure the key is on `/dev/sdb1/`
    * Obviously, I've taken a short-cut here
  * Run `./build.eeedora.bash`
  * This will build an ISO image of what you need
    * and will optionally install it onto the USB key
