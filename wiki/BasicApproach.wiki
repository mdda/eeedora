#summary How this whole thing works

= Introduction =

Fedora includes a tool called kickstart that makes building distributions 'easy'.

However, because this is entirely driven by RPMs, it's very difficult to get all the customization done in the kickstart file itself (since a 'round trip' takes about 45 minutes).

Also, since the Eee has non-standard drivers required for the wired ethernet (atl2) and wireless (Atheros), custom binaries also have to be 'shipped' within the ISO image.

Rather than face RPM version hell (since each user will probably be building this on slightly different kernel versions), I decided to take the easy way out :  Build a since RPM that contains a tar-ball of everything that's needed on the Eee itself.

= The RPM : eee_tarball =

In the `eee-setup` directory, there's a script that builds an RPM of scripts and settings, ready to be untarred in the /root/ directory.

From there, it's a simple matter for the kickstart file to untar in tar-ball, and run scripts within it.  This makes for a very extensible system, and makes each 'round-trip' incrementally more worthwhile.

The build-eeedora.bash script creates a local repository for the _one_ RPM, and then builds the ISO for the whole system.  From there, everything is automatic.
